## Tool-Based Interactive Software Parallelization: A Case Study @ ICSE 2018

This repository contains my [reveal.js][]-based presentation on Parceive.

## Running a local server
```sh
cd reveal
npm install # you can make sure that Python < 3 is used with `--python=python2.XYZ`
grunt serve --root=..
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000.
